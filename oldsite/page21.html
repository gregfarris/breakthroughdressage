 <font size="5"> Jamie</font> <font color="#000000">is a 1996 Appendix QH (7/8 TB) mare.  She is an experienced three-day event horse but has been ridden for the past year exclusively on the flat.  Sound, sweet and willing.  She is 15.2 and 1100 pounds, a very pretty bright bay with star, snip and two hind socks.  Jamie has impeccable ground manners.  She is a forward-moving girl who likes to go but never insists, never bucks and never bolts.  Great on the trails, both alone and with other horses.  A confident girl but not mare-ish. Very versatile horse. Jumping photos are from two years ago with former owner.  Others are last spring of beginner rider (with Aussie saddle!) and with Yr Johannsdottir, owner of Bailey.  More recent photos coming the next sunny day!  <br /><br />Jamie is offered for half lease (three days a week) to an approved intermediate rider at a monthly rate of $150, which includes riding privileges, all tack, pasture board (with her buddy Bella), vet, hoof care and supplements.  Jamie will be restricted from jumping so that she can concentrate on dressage with her owner/rider. Recent photos coming soon.  More photos from last spring of Jamie can be seen now under &quot;Horses in Training II&quot; button at left.  <br /><br />Serious candidates may take up to three test lessons with Jessie (without additional lesson charge) to assure good fit.  Contact Jessie to arrange for a test ride.  <br /><br /><table style="WIDTH: 100%" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/Quickstart/ImageLib/Jamie_web_1.jpg" /><br /></td><td><img src="/Quickstart/ImageLib/Jamie_web_2.jpg" /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/Quickstart/ImageLib/Jamie_web_3.jpg" /><br /></td><td><font color="#000000"><img src="/Quickstart/ImageLib/Jamie_web_4.jpg" /></font></td></tr></tbody></table><table style="WIDTH: 100%" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><img height="383" src="/Quickstart/ImageLib/Jamie_152.jpg" width="496" /><img height="504" src="/Quickstart/ImageLib/Jamie_046.jpg" width="378" /><br /></td><td><br /></td></tr><tr><td><img height="376" src="/Quickstart/ImageLib/Jamie_076.jpg" width="495" /><img height="414" src="/Quickstart/ImageLib/Jamie_177.jpg" width="497" /><br /></td><td><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br /></font>
